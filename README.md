# TEMPO-Maryland-Day
This is the Max MSP Patch that the TEMPO New Music Ensemble will use during our Maryland Day Performance. It is inspired by the minimalist/chance works of Terry Riely, such as in C. This patch generates small snipets to be performered by the ensemble. 

To run this patch, you will need to have Max MSP installed on your system.
