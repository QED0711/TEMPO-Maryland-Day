# TEMPO-Maryland-Day
This is the Max MSP Patch that the TEMPO New Music Ensemble will use during our Maryland Day Performance. It is inspired by the minimalist/chance works of Terry Riely, such as in C. This patch generates small snipets to be performered by the ensemble. 

The top level patch is titled TEMPO Maryland Day.maxpat. Open this file in Max msp to run the program. 

Note: You must have max 7 or later to run this patch.
